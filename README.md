# Abstract from ICC19 paper "Wideband Massive MIMO Channel Estimationfor Hybrid Beamforming Millimeter Wave Systems"

Millimeter Wave (mmWave) massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems realizing directive communication over large bandwidths via Hybrid analog and digital BeamForming (HBF) require reliable estimation of the wideband wireless channel. However, the hardware limitations with HBF architectures in conjunction with the short coherence time in mmWave communication render this estimation a challenging task. In this paper, we capitalize on recent matrix completion tools and develop a novel wideband channel estimation technique for mmWave massive MIMO systems with HBF reception. The proposed iterative algorithm exploits jointly the channel's low rank and beamspace sparsity to provide more accurate recovery, especially for short beam training intervals. We introduce a novel analog combining architecture that includes a random sub-sampling step before the input of the analog received signals to the digital component of the HBF receiver. This step supports the proposed estimation technique in providing the sampling set of measurements for recovering the unknown channel matrix. The impact of various system parameters on the effectiveness of the designed algorithm and the performance improvement of our technique over representative state-of-the-art ones is demonstrated through indicative simulation results.
